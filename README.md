# Text-Summarization
Project Overview
The Text Summarization project is a natural language processing (NLP) application that utilizes the T5 model to condense lengthy texts into concise summaries. This project leverages the power of transformer-based architectures to generate accurate and informative summaries.
Technical Details
The project relies on the following libraries:
Transformers: A popular Python library developed by Hugging Face, providing a wide range of pre-trained models and a simple interface for using them.
Torch: A machine learning framework used for building and training neural networks.
Gradio: A library for building and deploying machine learning models as interactive web applications.
The project consists of the following components:
Model: The T5-small model, a variant of the T5 architecture, is used for text-to-text generation tasks.
Tokenizer: The T5Tokenizer is employed to preprocess input texts and prepare them for the model.
Pipeline: A pipeline is created using the model and tokenizer to generate summaries.
Interface: A user-friendly interface is built using Gradio, allowing users to input text and receive a summarized output.
Functionality
The Text Summarization project provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input text and receive a concise summary. The project's functionality can be broken down into the following steps:
Text Input: Users input text into the interface.
Preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed using the T5Tokenizer.
Summary Generation: The preprocessed text is fed into the T5 model, which generates a summary.
Output: The generated summary is displayed to the user.
